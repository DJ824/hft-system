# hft-system
orderbook based hft system using live data 

This is the best I could come up with without actually sending orders to a broker, we use a client server model to mimic an entire trading system, where the 
server is the exchange, and the client is the trader. The server and client will be running on seperate cpu's to simulate network latency.
